    "Throughout a metropolis, the drone must deliver packages to several addresses. The city is shown as a grid map, with each cell denoting an open or restricted area. Obstacles such as towering buildings, trees, and airports are known as blocked cells, and they prevent drones from entering them. [[<sup id=\"fn1\">1</sup>](#fn1)]\n",

    "## I. Heuristic Function Method Justification \n",
    "#### 1. Overview Heuristic Function\n",
    "There are 3 well-known heuristic functions for 2D grid maps: [[<sup id=\"fn1\">2</sup>](#fn1)]\n",
    "- Manhattan distance ($L_1$)\n",
    "- Euclidean distance ($L_2$)\n",
    "- Diagonal distance ($L_∞$) (Chebyshev distance & Octile distance)\n",
    "\n",
    ">According to the given assessment task, the $\\textbf{Chebyshev distance}$ is the most appropriate heuristic for this implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Justification\n",
    "My chosen metric is **Chebyshev distance** because it is suitable for use as a heuristic in 2D grid-based pathfinding, especially when the drone can move diagonally. Because it takes into account the maximum distance in any direction (horizontally or vertically, or even diagonally), the Chebyshev distance is a good estimate of the grid’s two points apart.[[<sup id=\"fn1\">2</sup>](#fn1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In a grid based system, *the Chebyshev distance is better than Euclidean distance, especially when there can be diagonal movements by drones*. This is attributed to the fact that Euclidean measures straight line distances between two points whilst Chebyshev considers distances in all directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Benefits:___\n",
    "- *Efficiency*: Calculating the Chebyshev distance is computationally efficient and minimal calculations for real-time decisions.\n",
    "-\t*Admissibility*: The Chebyshev distance is never overestimates the true distance to the goal, which is important for the A* algorithm to work correctly.\n",
    "- *Scalability*: This heuristic scales well with the size of the city and the number of delivery zones. It remains effective regardless of the complexity of the city’s layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Limitations:___\n",
    "-\tThe Chebyshev distance is *not perfect and not suitable for 3D grid map. For example if 3D grid has many obstacles or narrow passages, Chebyshev distance may not give the shortest path.\n",
    "-\tThe Chebyshev distance does not take into account the drone's movement constraints, such as its speed and acceleration.\n",
    "-   The length of the path may not be optimal if the current start point is too far from the delivery point.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Therefore, I went for the **Chebyshev distance heuristic** because it is an appropriate heuristic for grid-based pathfinding, particularly when drones can move diagonally. It results in eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) [[<sup id=\"fn1\">4</sup>](#fn1)]. It gives a good approximation of the distance between two points in a **2D grid map** that is needed by the A* algorithm to find the shortest path. Additionally, the total path length computed by the Chebyshev distance is much less than that compared to Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance._"

    "## VI. Analysis & Conclusion\n",
    "##### Case 1: Nevada State\n",
    "As shown in the city map visualization, the drone needs to deliver packages to two address points. Both of these points are surrounded by obstacles, which block all possible paths. As a result, the drone is unable to reach the destination points, making successful package delivery impossible in this case.\n",
    ">>> Overall, the A* algorithm not successfully delivered packages in this scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 2: New York City\n",
    "**Path Description:**\n",
    "The A* algorithm was able to produce probable routes from the commencement point, Node 3, 4, to various delivery locations, Node 0, 3, Node 1, 2, Node 7, 4, Node 9, 2 in New York City. The compute path is also shown in the city map and connects such points. Even more importantly, the line is not straight, which means that the algorithm considered other intermediate points before arriving at the shortest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Metrics:**\n",
    "- Number of Nodes: In total, it encompasses 15 nodes, and one of them is the start node. Nodes represent cells of the grid.\n",
    "- Total Path Cost: 14 , the physical distance that was taken by the algorithm was at its minimum. This efficiency is the one that is most crucial for the delivery of packages.\n",
    "- Execution Time and Memory Usage: Notably, impressively about the A* algorithm the solution was reached with about 0.001289 seconds to make and it used up 320 bytes of memory space (city map and final path).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effectiveness Assessment:** \n",
    "Considering the constraints of an urban environment, where direct routes may be obstructed by unseen obstacles, this path is effective. The computed path length (approximately 17.314 units) suggests efficiency. \n",
    ">>> Hence, by apply the A* algorithm wth Chebyshev heuristic, the drone successfully delivered the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 3: Chicago City\n",
    "**Path Description:** \n",
    "The A* algorithm was able to identify potential routes starting from the location of the delivery hub (Node 2, 4) to several delivery locations (Node 0, 2, Node 8, 2, Node 8, 9,) in Chicago City. The drone's movement is also illustrated in the city map and it connects such points. Most important, the line is jagged meaning that the algorithm analyzed different mid-points to come up with the shortest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Metrics:**\n",
    "- Number of Nodes: The path comprises 19 nodes, including the start point. Each node represents a grid cell.\n",
    "- Total Path Cost: 18, the algorithm minimized the actual distance traveled. This efficiency is crucial for package delivery.\n",
    "- Execution Time and Memory Usage: Impressively, the A* algorithm executed approximately 0.001565 seconds and used up 384 bytes of memory  (city map and the final path).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effectiveness Assessment:** \n",
    "Considering the constraints of an urban environment, where direct routes may be obstructed by unknown obstacles, this path is effective. The computed path length (approximately 20.899 units) suggests efficiency. \n",
    ">>> In summary, the A* algorithm performed well, considering the provided metrics with its value and the Chebychev distance heuristic. The packages were delivered successfully along this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 4: Shanghai City\n",
    "**Path Description:** \n",
    "The A* algorithm successfully navigated from the starting location (0, 0) to the specified delivery addresses (5, 1), (10, 19), (15, 15) and (19, 19) in Shanghai city. The delivery path, visually represented on the city map, connects those points. Notably, the path is non-linear, indicating that the algorithm considered various intermediate nodes to optimize the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Metrics:**\n",
    "- Number of Nodes: The path comprises 38 nodes, including the start point. Each node represents a grid cell.\n",
    "- Total Path Cost: 37, the algorithm minimized the actual distance traveled. This efficiency is critical for package delivery.\n",
    "- Execution Time and Memory Usage: Impressively, the A* algorithm executed approximately 0.001744 seconds and used 592 bytes of memory (city map and the final path).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effectiveness Assessment:**\n",
    " Considering the constraints of an urban environment, where direct routes may be obstructed by unseen obstacles, this path is effective. The computed path length (approximately 41.556 units) suggests efficiency. \n",
    ">>> Therefore, by approach A* algorithm wth Chebyshev heuristic, the drone successfully delivered the packages.\n",
