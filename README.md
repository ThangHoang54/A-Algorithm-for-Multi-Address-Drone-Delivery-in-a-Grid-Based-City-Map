# A-Algorithm-for-Multi-Address-Drone-Delivery-in-a-Grid-Based-City-Map 🚁
     
Welcome to the repository! This project serves as the Assignment 2 source code 
for COSC2968|COSC3053 Foundation of Artificial Intelligence for STEM course.

## Introduction 📋

Suppose you are employed by a delivery company that uses drones to deliver packages. Your job is to create an AI program that uses the A* (A star) algorithm to determine the optimal flight paths for delivery drones.
Throughout a metropolis, the drone must deliver packages to several addresses. The city is shown as a grid map, with each cell denoting an open or restricted area. Obstacles such as towering buildings, trees, and airports are known as blocked cells, and they prevent drones from entering them.

## Addition Note 📱
**The provided code includes the following notes:**
1. In this program, the location point (address) is represented by coordinates (x, y). Where:

 > <p style = "text-align: center;">x is the distance of this point along the row-axis from the original.</p>
 > <p style = "text-align: center;">y is the distance of this point along the column-axis from the original.</p>

2. This visualization map does not have its legend display next to since the Tkinter library does not provide any related built-in functions. Instead, **the legend will be represented in section IV**.  
3. The analysis of the solution's efficiency will be displayed in the corresponding console.
